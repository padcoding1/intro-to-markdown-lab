When you're home by yourself and mama ain't nowheres to be found to make you a lovely meal, you need to take it upon yourself to create a scrumptious delight. Here are the basics to fill your belly and sustain you in a pinch.

## 1. Ingredients

- **Two slices of bread**: Choose a great tasting bread. Here at General Assembly we love honey wheat, but you can use any bread you want. If it's not _sliced_, go ahead and slice off two pieces of bangin' bread in equal thicknesses.
  > Tip: Keep your slices below 3/4" in thickness. Too much bread with each bite will just be dry and lame.
- **Peanut Butter**: We recommend all natural, but you can choose whatever you want! Honey peanut butter, almond butter, you can even use a spread like **_Trader Joe's COOKIE BUTTER!_**
- **Jelly**: Jelly, jam, marmalade, preserves- they're all amazing. Choose your favorite flavor.
- **Butter/Table Knife**: It has to fit in the jar of peanut butter and the jelly. Don't overthink this. Just grab a non-super-sharp knife.
- \_Optional:**Spoon**: Got no knives? Use a spoon.

## 2. Spread Ingredients

1. Get you a healthy amount of peanut butter- just a big spoonful. Spread that out on one piece of bread. If you love it, do for two. You do you, boo.
2. Clean that knife off. Okay, YES, you can lick it off, but were you raise as a barbarian? Clean the knife off under the sink.
3. Spread the jelly. The knife can be frustrating to deal with if the jelly is thin, but you'll manage. Spread some jelly onto the other piece of bread.

## 3. _"Autobots, assemble!"_

Take the piece of bread with the **_peanut butter_** and lay it peanut-butter-side down on top of the bread with the jelly. Line them up so they look mostly sandwich-like.

> Tip: Don't pick up the piece with the jelly. It usually oozes a lot and may dump jelly everywhere when you flip it and place it on top.

### You're all done! NOW EAT IT!
